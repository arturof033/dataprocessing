# Data Processing Application

Homayoun Nistanaki and Arturo Flores

Languages Used: C++

This data processing application tokenizes the contents of a .cpp file. The .cpp file will be read and transferred into a string, where any excess spaces and comments will be removed. Afterward, this program will parse through the string, sort each lexeme according to its token type, and display a list of each lexeme found next to its respective token type and the number of tokens found in the code. To read the file, the user must first type in the name of the file to be parsed through, where the program will decide whether or not it is valid; an error message will appear if the file cannot be read and the program will continue otherwise.
